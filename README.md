Created a Belly Button Biodiversity dashboard where participants in a bacterial study can enter their subject ID in a dropdown and the page load several dynamic tables:
1. A demographic panel with their basic info
2. A bar chart with the top ten most prevalent bacterial samples found
3. An indicator gauge showing their washing frequency
4. A bubble graph showing all bacterial samples with greater samples having larger marker circles
